9-29 Update

Fixed previous bootstrap styling issues on all pages
Modified the styling of the portfolio page, to include projects and homework worked on throughout the class to this point
Included links to git hub and hosted links for each project item
Added buttons to personal sites on the contact page

Created the framework of a portfolio website

Index contains a short about me with an image, that is responsive.
portfolio contains a small image gallery showing off some of my works. The image gallery is responsive and will change based on the viewport.
contact contains a small unfunctional contact me page, that is also responsive.

All pages include a responsive header and footer.
